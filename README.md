# JavaScript vs TypeScript: A Developers perspective 

![Alt ](https://tsh.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/typescript-vs-javascript-comparison_.jpg)

### Introduction
JavaScript is a **dynamic**, loosely typed language widely used for web development. TypeScript, on the other hand, is a strongly typed **superset of JavaScript** that provides static typing and other powerful features.

> "TypeScript is JavaScript with syntax for types." – Microsoft
## key differences  
|Feature|JavaScript|Typescript|
|:-------|:---------: | :--------:|
|Type System	|Dynamically typed	|Statically typed
|Compilation	|Runs directly in browsers	|Needs to be compiled to JavaScript
|Error Detection	|Detected at runtime |	Detected at compile-time
|Tooling & Debugging	|Limited static analysis	|Better IntelliSense & error detection
|Learning Curve |	Easier for beginners	|Requires learning types & compilation
|Code Scalability	|Less maintainable for large projects	|Better for large-scale applications

### Why Choose TypeScript Over JavaScript?

1. Improved Code Quality
    - Detects errors before execution
    - Reduces debugging time
    - Better Developer Experience

2. Offers IntelliSense for better code suggestions
    - Provides better code documentation with types
    - Enhanced Maintainability

3. Code is more structured and readable
    - Helps in large-scale applications with multiple developers
    - Static Typing Benefits

####  JavaScript Example
```
 var name = "Renuka"; // Can store any value
console.log(name);  // Output: Renuka

name = 25; // No error, but may cause issues later
console.log(name);  // Output: 25
```
#### TypeScript Example
```
var name: string = "Renuka"; // Explicitly defined as a string
console.log(name); // Output: Renuka

// name = 25; // ❌ Error: Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'
```

# JavaScript or TypeScript?

>✅ Use JavaScript if you're working on small projects or quick prototypes.
> ✅ Use TypeScript for large applications, enterprise projects, or when working in teams.
